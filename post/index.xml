E-commerce growth has supported the proliferation of 3PL services, however, it is difficult for these companies to stay competitive without embracing robotic automation. This problem has been exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic and the related social distancing measures, which necessarily reduce the ability to process parcels quickly and efficiently.</description></item><item><title>Seyo raises £1.53m to make robotics accessible to more than just the Amazons of the world</title><link>https://seyolimited.github.io/post/2021/02/seyo-raises-1.53m-to-make-robotics-accessible-to-more-than-just-the-amazons-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seyolimited.github.io/post/2021/02/seyo-raises-1.53m-to-make-robotics-accessible-to-more-than-just-the-amazons-of-the-world/</guid><description>Logistics heavy companies understand the value of robots in their warehouses, a need that continues to grow. Many startups have emerged to provide these robots. But if you&amp;rsquo;re not Amazon or a Walmart, financing and implementing robotics automation is no walk in the park. As a result, only 0.2% of warehouses have implemented any form of robotic automation.
Seyo is filling this gap in the market by providing the first platform that allows companies to design their robotic warehouses, without needing advanced engineering skills.</description></item></channel></rss>
